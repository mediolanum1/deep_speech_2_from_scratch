## About

This repository contains a implementation of Deep Speech 2 Automatic Speech Recognition model made form scatch with PyTorch. DeepSpeech 2 is an end-to-end deep learning model designed for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to process raw audio features (e.g., spectrograms) and predict corresponding text transcriptions.
